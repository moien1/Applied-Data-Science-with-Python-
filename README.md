# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python

**In this course you will lear:**

- You'll get an introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality and features which data scientists use

- You'll learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and processing -- pandas.               You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. 

- You'll deepen your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. We'll also refresh your understanding of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis.

- you'll be introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests. The majority of the week will be dedicated to your course project, where you'll engage in a real-world data cleaning activity and provide evidence for (or against!) a given hypothesis. This project is suitable for a data science portfolio, and will test your knowledge of cleaning, merging, manipulating, and test for significance in data. 

Learning Objectives:
- Recognize the meaning of the term "Data Science",
- Develop basic Python programs using strings, functions, lists, dictionaries, date/time features, and files,
- Use advanced Python features, including lambdas, list comprehensions and the numpy library,
- Create Series and DataFrame Data Structures,
- Use pandas math functions, as well as broadcasting features,
- Employ the pandas library to import and manipulate data,
- Apply indexing and querying to DataFrames, and deal with missing values,
- Apply merge and join on DataFrames,
- Employ slicing and indexing on DataFrames,
- Analyze data with groupby and understand categorical variables,
- Produce the entire process of data source to elucidation,
- Examine the data by manipulating, cutting, and applying aggregate functions to DataFrames,
- Identify your understanding of basic statistics
- Recognize different distributions such as binomial, uniform, normal, and chi-squared
- Interpret data to evaluate hypothesis tests

David Donoho, Stanford University, article on the last 50 years of Data Science and the direction the field is headed. This is a fairly long and academic article, but is excellent overview of the field.

**The Six Divisions**

The activities of Greater Data Science are classified into 6 divisions:

1. Data Exploration and Preparation
2. Data Representation and Transformation 3. Computing with Data
4. Data Modeling
5. Data Visualization and Presentation
6. Science about Data Science

 **scales:**

1. Nominal Scale. Nominal variables (also called categorical variables) can be placed into categories. They don’t have a numeric value and so cannot be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied. They also have no order; if they appear to have an order then you probably have ordinal variables instead.
 
2. Ordinal Scale. The ordinal scale contains things that you can place in order. For example, hottest to coldest, lightest to heaviest, richest to poorest. Basically, if you can rank data by 1st, 2nd, 3rd place (and so on), then you have data that’s on an ordinal scale.

3. Interval Scale. An interval scale has ordered numbers with meaningful divisions. Temperature is on the interval scale: a difference of 10 degrees between 90 and 100 means the same as 10 degrees between 150 and 160. Compare that to high school ranking (which is ordinal), where the difference between 1st and 2nd might be .01 and between 10th and 11th .5. If you have meaningful divisions, you have something on the interval scale.

4. Ratio Scale. The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale with one major difference: zero is meaningful. For example, a height of zero is meaningful (it means you don’t exist). Compare that to a temperature of zero, which while it exists, it doesn’t mean anything in particular (although admittedly, in the Celsius scale it’s the freezing point for water)
